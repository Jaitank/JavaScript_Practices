// Lets create a user's information with variables:

var fullName =  "Jai Tank";

const uid = "abc123";   // we can't overwrite it becuase this is not variable, and we want it as unique id

var email = "tankjai23@gmail.com";

var password = "123456";

var country = "India";

var state = "Rajasthan";


console.log(`
          With User ID: ${uid}
          User is : ${fullName}
          having email : ${email}
          from : ${state} , ${country}
